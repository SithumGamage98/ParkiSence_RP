## My Component - Early time Parkinsonâ€™s disease detection with keystroke data logs generated from movements shown by fingers of human hand when performing the keystrokes


#### The main goal of my individual contribution to the group research effort is to create a thorough and precise early Parkinson's disease detection system employing keystroke data logs produced from finger motions made by the human hand while typing. Data collection, feature extraction, machine learning model building, longitudinal analysis, and the development of a user-friendly online application are some of the major components that make up this goal. By completing this task, I hope to make progress toward the bigger target of developing a reliable Parkinson's disease detection and treatment recommendation system based on artificial intelligence
